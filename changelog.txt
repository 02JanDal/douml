Features
	1. Added "Catalog" widget below class tree. This widget is used for quick tree navigation and has 3 tabs.
		"Visited" tab updates each time user clicks on a node in a tree. This node is inserted into visited and clicking on it will.
		immediately scroll the main tree to it.
		"Marked" tab tracks user selection and serves double purpose of tree navigation(as in "Visited") and node deselection via rightclick menu.
		"Favourites" tab is used when user ahs often visited tree nodes and wants an easy wasy to return to the in a tree.
		Adding nodes s done by dragging them from the main tree onto favourites tabs.
		Catalog widget has line edit under tabs which serves the purpose of filtering the Visited view (only Visited atm).
	2. "Builtin types" tab in generation settings has been completely reworked. 
		User can now search and sort it.
		User can selectively turn off languages he does not use in the table.
		When a new row is being produced it is initialized with enough defaults to make assigning UML name the only obligatory edit before clicking "OK".
		Adding new rows is now done through "Add type" button and a few options were removed from "do" menu as they no longer make sense.
